Some jumping commands that I had not come across until today.

- `gd` will take you to the local declaration.
- `gD` will take you to the global declaration.
- `g*` search for the word under the cursor (like *, but g* on 'rain' will find
  words like 'rainbow').
- `g#` same as g* but in backward direction.

Except for `gD`, These also work in evil mode.

I have been playing around with dramatic CSS 3D transforms, and I stumbled into
the `will-change` CSS attribute. In short, you can specify which CSS
modifications you are likely to make in the feature so the browser can prepare
some optimizations for you. This worked _shockingly_ well for my needs. (You can
see the page in action [here](http://zakandrewking.github.io/osp/).)
